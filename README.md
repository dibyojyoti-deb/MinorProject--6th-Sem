FarmScore is a project that proposes a machine learning model to assess the creditworthiness of small-scale farms in India. The model uses geospatial data, land records, and historical yields to predict crop yields for new farms. This information is then used to calculate a FarmScore, which reflects the farm's creditworthiness by estimating its potential profitability and ability to repay loans.

The project also explores the concept of dynamic interest rates linked to FarmScore. This concept has interesting possibilities but raises questions about the potential for further penalizing low-scoring farms and ensuring transparency and fairness.
